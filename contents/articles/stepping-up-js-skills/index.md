Recently, I've been interviewing candidates for front end web development positions and have been noticing that there are two kinds of Javascript developers: one that creates movement and fancy UI's for marketing sites and one that creates complex Rich Internet Applications (RIA).

As we all know, there has been a huge change in how JavaScript is being used on the web. Previously, one could get away with using jQuery for various carousels, dropdown menus and other UI doodads, but, now, complex applications and data modeling. As Rich Internet Applications become the expected norm, front end developers can't get away with only using jQuery.

## 'I keep getting this question about closures'

Learn how to use `.call` and `.apply` and `.bind` and why they are necessary.

```
function log(){
	var args = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments);
	console.log.apply(console, args);
}
```

```
var stuff = {
	line : 'say these things',
	say :  function(name) {
		console.log(name + ' ' + this.line);
	}
}

var things = {
	line: 'other things'
}

stuff.say.call(things, 'mimi');

var other = stuff.say.bind(stuff);

other('someone needs to');
```
