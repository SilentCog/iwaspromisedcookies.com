Lets say you're a front-end developer that has historically worked on marketing sites. The most complicated 'app' aspect of this marketing site are the search and contact forms and those were mostly managed by a CMS. You want a new job but all the new jobs are looking for front-end developers that build applications with complex interactions and huge Javascript codebases. The couple of interviews you've recently had were bad and a little embarrassing, but you feel confident in your knowledge of Javascript.

Recently, I've been interviewing candidates for front end web development positions and have been noticing that there are two kinds of Javascript developers: one that creates movement and fancy UI's for marketing sites and one that creates complex Rich Internet Applications (RIA).

The issue here is that a person doesn't know what they don't know. You can do everything you have ever been asked to do with your current skillset, but you can't do the things you might need to as a Javascript developer.

As we all know, there has been a huge change in how JavaScript is being used on the web. Previously, one could get away with using jQuery for various carousels, dropdown menus and other UI doodads, but, now, complex applications and data modeling. As Rich Internet Applications become the expected norm, front end developers can't get away with only using jQuery.

## 'I keep getting this question about closures'

Scope is a big deal. If you don't understand the scope of a variable in Javascript, you will run into all kinds of bugs that feel like phantoms.

Learn how to use `.call` and `.apply` and `.bind` and why they are necessary.

```javascript
function log(){
    var args = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments);
    console.log.apply(console, args);
}
```

```javascript
var stuff = {
line : 'say these things',
       say :  function(name) {
           console.log(name + ' ' + this.line);
       }
}

var things = {
line: 'other things'
}

stuff.say.call(things, 'mimi');

var other = stuff.say.bind(stuff);

other('someone needs to');
```

* Learn about prototypical inheritance

* Learn about variable scope (hoisting, `this`, `.call` and `.apply` and `.bind`)

* Understand why the JS tools and frameworks you use work, what problem they were created to fix, and what alternatives are available.

## Codewars

A great way to review and further learn more about Javascript fundamentals is through [Codewars](http://codewars.com). Sign up and do all the 'kata' that you can. If you Google something and use it to get through a 'kata' be sure you understand why it works. Don't be lazy about this understanding. Its really going to help once you get to writing code for real projects with real teams.
