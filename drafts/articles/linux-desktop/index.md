I've decided to 'take the plunge' and use my old trusty MacBook Air as a single boot Linux box. I got a shiny new MBA, so I figured it could be fun to go ahead and make a 'beater' machine out of my old one that I could toss in my bag and skate around town without worrying about ruining my sweet new laptop.

This is an overview of the things I did to get Xubuntu up and running in a workable fashion on my old MacBook Air (3,1).

## Why Xubuntu?

I decided against Ubuntu's default Unity desktop because I worried the 2GB of RAM would be pushed too hard with all the fancy graphics. Mac OS X Yosemite was running rather slow this 5 year old computer after the last update, so, the little laptop's age was showing.

XFCE, the X in Xubuntu, is a lighter weight desktop environment, making it faster, although less polished. No shadows here, but, that's hardcore, right? Whats the point of running Linux on a tiny laptop other than to be hardcore?!
