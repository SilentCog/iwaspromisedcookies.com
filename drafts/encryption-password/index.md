## [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org/)

Why pay for a service to keep your passwords safe when you can use a free and open source password manager like KeyPassXC? The passwords in KeyPassXC can either be added or generated and the database of passwords is encrypted using a 256 bit key with the option to authenticate with a key fie in addition to a password.


## [macOS GPG Suite](https://gpgtools.org/)

This suite includes tools to integrate encryption services into macOS Apple Mail, a 'keychain' to help browse and manage encryption keys either locally or on keyservers, and an overall GPG service integration that allows for decryting selected text, files, and folders.

## [Enigmail](https://www.enigmail.net/index.php/en/) with [Thunderbird](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/)

For those on Linux or Windows (or even macOS and want an alternative to Apple Mail), GPG encrytion tools are available via the Enigmail plugin for the Thunderbird mail client created by Mozilla.
